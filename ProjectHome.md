# Introduction #

This project provides a simple Mac OS X driver for a USB MIDI interface found on Casio keyboards.

This is entirely based on the SampleUSBMIDIDriver provided by Apple with the CoreAudio SDK.

You can download it for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and up here:

[Casio USB Midi Driver (Installer Package)](http://casiousbmididriver.googlecode.com/files/Casio%20USB%20MIDI%20Driver%20%2810.7%29.pkg)

Older version of this driver are available in the Downloads page, but are not supported.

Please also visit the [Compatibility Reports](Compatibility.md) wiki page and add your keyboard if it's not already there.

# Installation #

To install the driver, simply double-click on the package. It will install for all users on your machine.

You should then be able to plug your keyboard with a USB cable and power it up, it will show up in the Audio & MIDI Setup utility as "Casio USB Keyboard".
